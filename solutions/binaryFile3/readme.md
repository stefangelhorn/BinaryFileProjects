# Purpose of folder `binaryFile3`
You can create your own solutions on a different branch (I'll use `solutions-soeren`) and if one want we can discuss them together at some point.

## Questions to original author

I'm just wondering what you're trying to archive with this code.

It doesn't look like you're doing anything new here. On top of that: The files in binaryFile1, binaryFile2 and binaryFile1 don't look like they contain any exercises for students.
What exactly are they?

I presume they are teaching material, so I change them only a bit to keep as close to their original functionality as possible.
If you want to see alternative approaches I'd happily change them more drastically.
